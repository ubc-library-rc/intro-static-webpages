# Introduction

While you may have heard of some popular website-building tools (like WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace) and may have even used them, this workshop will introduce you to a different tool used to create a different kind of website, namely a static website. While learning to build a static website takes a little bit more time than using a tool like WordPress, static sites have many benefits and use cases â€” in particular in academic, research, and professional environments. The skills used to build static websites will also be useful in many other areas.
