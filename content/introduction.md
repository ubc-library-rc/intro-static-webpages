# Introduction

While you may have heard of some popular website-building tools (like WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace) and may have even used them, this workshop will introduce you to a different tool used to create a different kind of website, namely a static website. While learning to build a static website takes a little bit more time and investment than using a “ready to use” tool like WordPress, static sites have many benefits and use cases — in particular in academic, research, and professional environments. Learning the skills used to build static websites will also net you a variety of technical skills you can apply elsewhere. 

Questions for Participants:

* Has anyone created or tried to create a website or webpage before? This includes website-building tools like WordPress, blogging platforms, or others you might’ve used. 
* Has anyone used Git or GitHub before?
