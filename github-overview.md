# GitHub

GitHub is a remote, cloud service designed for collaborative code development, change tracking, and version control.

GitHub is built on top of Git, which is the tool responsible for version control. For a full setup, you would install Git and run it on your local computer, and then push (“upload”) that content to the cloud. We won’t use the full setup of Git and GitHub, but we’ll focus instead on just GitHub, which you can access using a browser. For more advanced uses, you may want to think about learning Git and how to make changes locally. 

First, you will be setting up a new project repository on GitHub. This will eventually be turned into a website. The repository is where all the folders and files, including any images or media, for your project will go. The repository is also a way for others to view the “raw” content of your website and for collaborators to contribute to a shared repository. By default, GitHub will track changes to materials that are stored in a repository. 

GitHub Pages is the feature that will knit your repository into a functioning website. "[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website." While you can build your website from a subsection of your repository, it is a good practice to create a new repository for each project or website.
