# GitHub

GitHub is a remote, cloud service designed for collaborative code development and change tracking and version control. GitHub is built on top of Git, which is the tool responsible for version control. For a full setup, you would install Git and run it on your local computer, and then push (“upload”) that content to the cloud. We won’t use the full setup of Git and GitHub, but we’ll focus instead on just GitHub, which you can access using a browser. For more advanced uses, you may want to think about learning Git and how to make changes locally.
