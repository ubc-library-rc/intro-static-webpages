## Introduction

This workshop will introduce you to static web pages and give you the skills to create and publish static web pages using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We will walk through the steps to set up a GitHub repository, author content in Markdown, and customize your site. We’ll cover important concepts, use cases, and best practices for working with static web pages. Throughout the workshop, participants will build technical familiarity and confidence to create static sites for academic, research, and professional use. This is an introductory workshop and no prior experience is required. 

## Pre-workshop Setup

You do not have to do much in advance of this workshop. It is recommended that you register for a GitHub account at [GitHub.com](github.com) in advance of the workshop. This workshop will use a web browser only, so there is no need to install Git or GitHub locally. However, if you’d like to learn more about Git and GitHub before the workshop, you can view materials for the [Intro to Git and GitHub workshop](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-git/)
