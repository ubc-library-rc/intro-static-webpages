## Introduction

This workshop will introduce you to static web pages and give you the skills to create and publish simple web pages using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We will walk through the steps and suite of tools (GitHub, GitHub Pages, Markdown) used to create static sites for a variety of academic, research, and professional use. This is an introductory workshop and no prior experience is required. 

## Pre-workshop Setup

* Register for a GitHub account at [GitHub.com](github.com). 

This workshop will use a web browser only, so there is no need to install Git or GitHub locally. However, if youâ€™d like to learn more about Git and GitHub before the workshop, check out the materials for the [Intro to Git and GitHub workshop](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-git/)

## Learning objectives

* Learn about the concept of static websites and their uses in academic environments
* Create a GitHub repository and add, edit, and manage files
