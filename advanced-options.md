So far, our static site isn't looking like anything too special. There are a couple of ways that we can spruce up the look and feel of our site.  This means playing around with YAML. YAML is basically a series of key value pairs and is wrapped by three dashes `---` placed at the top of your document:

```

YAML is space sensitive, so no spaces before the key, one space after the colon, and if you need to indent, an indent consists of two spaces.
