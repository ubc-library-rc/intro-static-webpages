---

In an academic environment, there are many reasons why you may wish to build and deploy a static web site. This includes:

**Poster presentations**

You can't say everything on a poster. Add a QR code and link to a static page with more information, contact details etc. There are many places to get a QR code generated; a great free option is QRCode Monkey - https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/ 

**Academic CVs**

Applying for jobs, placements etc - link to a static page that demonstrates a skill set (building web content!) and potentially collect metrics with Google Analytics.

**Research profile**

Build out a full blown site (multiple pages) that allows visitors to know more about you

**Scholarly Communication**

Share your knowledge. Might be a blog. Might be a how to.

**Project website**

Build a basic site or full blown site about a major project you’re part of. Invite others to collaborate. Note that some projects might need more advanced development or a dynamic site

## Recap

For many academic purposes, static sites are a good option. Static sites have much faster load times, which makes these sites more accessible even to those with internet limitations, meaning more people around the world can access the information on your site. If you are in sectors where tech skills are valued, going through the process of building a static site can help you develop and flex those skills. You also have more control over your content for customization as well as migration, if you ever want to move your website somewhere else. And if you’re using GitHub or Git already for version control or collaboration, GitHub Pages can be integrated into your project or team workflows. As you’ll see from our examples, you can create some great static web pages or sites for a number of different uses in the academic and research environment.
