## Adding files and folders

With that basic understanding of website structure, you will create a folder structure in your GitHub repository that will consist of the components of your website. You’ll create a file and folder in your repository and upload a file from your computer to your new folder. 

### 1. Create a file (index.md)

Step 1
{: .label .label-step}
In the top-level repository page (which you can navigate to by clicking the &lt;> Code tab), click Add file > Create new file
{: .step}

Step 2
{: .label .label-step}
When prompted to name your file, title it index.md. This creates an empty text file that GitHub will assume contains Markdown code.
{: .step}

Step 3
{: .label .label-step}
Scroll down to the Commit new file section. We won’t add anything to this new file for now–we’ll do that when we talk about Markdown.
{: .step}

### 2. Create a folder

Step 1
{: .label .label-step}
In the top-level repository page, click Add file > Create new file
{: .step}

Step 2
{: .label .label-step}
When prompted to name your file, enter images/temp.txt. Commit your changes. This will create a folder called images and an empty file inside of it called temp.txt (which can be deleted later, once you’ve moved more files into the images folder).
{: .step}

### 3. Upload a file

Step 1
{: .label .label-step}
Make sure you are located within the images folder (you should see your temp.txt file).
{: .step}

Step 2
{: .label .label-step}
Click Add file > Upload files.
{: .step}

Step 3
{: .label .label-step}
Select an image from your computer to upload. If you want to download something from the web, try to use something that is not copyrighted or is royalty free ([e.g.](https://www.pexels.com/royalty-free-images/))
{: .step}

Step 4
{: .label .label-step}
Commit your changes
